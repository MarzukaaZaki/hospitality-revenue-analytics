# Hospitality Revenue Analytics Project

## Introduction
AtliQ Grands, a renowned hospitality group with a 20-year legacy in India's luxury and business hotel sector, has faced recent challenges due to increased competition and strategic oversights. To regain market share and revenue, the managing director initiated a project to leverage Business Intelligence (BI) and data analysis.

## Problem Statement
AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.

Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them with insights from their historical data.

## Project Details
This project aimed to utilize historical data to gain valuable insights and inform strategic decision-making. The main stakeholders in this project are the managing director, who initiated the project and the revenue management team, who were tasked with hiring 3rd party service provider and utilizing the insights to improve revenue.
